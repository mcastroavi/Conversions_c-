Problem 1:
Write a function that check if number is prime or not

Problem 2:
Write C++ function that can perform the following task:

read in robotpath.dat each line contains distance (in meters) and angle (in degrees) that is in polar coordinates form
convert angle to radians Good design principle: always keep numbers in one internal format in this case, since sin, cos, etc use radians, do all computation and store all variables in radians.
print out x,y location at each step accurate to 8 digits, using setprecision()

use the calculated x and y to find the angle in radian.
Problem 3:
Write code that Calculate the wind chill using the below formula:
Wind Chill = 35.74 + 0.6215T â€“ 35.75(V^0.16) + 0.4275T(V^0.16)
Note: Windchill Temperature is only defined for temperatures at or below 50 degrees F and wind speeds above 3 mph.
Hint: design a function using the above formula
